Home & Kitchen,MIYABI Artisan 8-inch Chef's Knife,2634,$329.99,,Measuring 20 cm in length- the GYUTOH knife is suitable for cutting and separating fish and meat. Its pointed tip and sturdy blade enable clean cuts to be made. The handle’s flat finishing ensures safety by preventing your hand from slipping from the handle onto the blade. Miyabi also uses a Japanese blade profile- meaning that the GYUTOH combines high-cutting quality properties with comfort. The blade is made of a micro-carbide powder steel core wrapped in two additional layers of steel. The blade is hammer-forged- giving it an appearance slightly reminiscent of the Tschumine design. In addition- each blade of the MIYABI 600MCT series is put through different ice-hardening processes which must be completed at -196°C- so that a final hardness of around 63 Rockwell is achieved. The blade is polished on both sides and finished by hand using Honbazuke honing. The handle on the other hand is made out of pakka wood- which has a subtle pattern and stands out thanks to its sturdiness and flexibility. The perfect balance enables a high level of comfort and lets you work without tiring- thus making the knife from Miyabi a useful cutting utensil in your kitchen.[newline]SG2 micro-carbide powder steel[newline]Authentic thin Japanese blade profile[newline]Hand-honed using the three-step Honbazuke process for a 9.5 to 12 degree edge[newline]CRYODUR blade- ice-hardened to Rockwell 63[newline]SG2 core is protected by two layers and finished with a katana edge[newline]D-shaped Cocobolo pakkawood handle[newline]Hammered "Tsuchime" finish[newline]Hand wash only[newline]Handcrafted in Seki- Japan[newline]Product Number: SP32871,https://assets.sellers.loblaw.ca/products/all/1094/32871_1.jpg?size=274,https://www.loblaws.ca/miyabi-artisan-8-inch-chef-s-knife/p/SP32871

The exquisite design makes the French oven really stand out and adds an interesting touch to the table when it is used for serving. With its conical form and the rounded edges- the French oven is ideal for all dishes that are frequently stirred- allowing the cooking spoon to reach every corner. Try it with recipes such as "vegetable pilaf with saffron and chicken breast" or a creamy risotto. The French oven is suitable for all types of hobs and can also be used inside the oven- for example to bake bread in a perfect rounded shape.[newline]Product Number: SP44548,https://assets.sellers.loblaw.ca/products/all/1094/44548_1.jpg?size=274,https://www.loblaws.ca/staub-essential-oven-5-25q-grey/p/SP44548
