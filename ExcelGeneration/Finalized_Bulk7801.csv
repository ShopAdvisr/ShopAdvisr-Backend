Toys- Games & Hobbies,Maranda - Trappex Strategy Game,7977,$39.95,,Playing Trappex is a little bit like reuniting with an old friend. While it is comforting to rekindle childhood memories with the time-tested "Dots and Boxes" play pattern- there is still something new and different about how the game has grown up in the meantime. Even though Trappex is quick and easy to learn- there is a depth of strategy that will keep you alert from your first move till your last. To play- players take turns placing their wooden "wall" pieces on the board- attempting to complete squares while preventing their opponent from doing the same. The player with the most completed squares at the end of the game wins. Trappex is simple enough to be played by children- strategic enough to engage a true gamer. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner- no ties- stalemates- or cat's games. Handcrafted from high-quality hardwoods- Trappex is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.[newline]Product Number: SP151707,https://assets.sellers.loblaw.ca/products/all/1231/151707_2266510250_2.jpg?size=274,https://www.loblaws.ca/maranda-trappex-strategy-game/p/SP151707

Glory- fame- hot feet - whatever the reason- you're doing it.You move ahead in the game by completing actions in six categories- possibly making up outrageous lies about yourself- freshening up with a quick shower in your host's bathroom- or acting out the words "butter patty". The categories are:" The Volcano Has Spoken - Roll a black and you'll be subject to the whims of the volatile FURT volcano- which is sometimes angry- sort of bossy and always a bit weird." Straight-Faced - Can you keep a straight face while your friends and family members assault you with funny words? You're about to find out (psst: fluffer nougat- pussy willow- burp nut) whenever you roll a red." Guess What? - The volcano is chock full of funny words and you may find yourself acting out the phrase "butter patty" or drawing an invisible jet to get your friends to guess your word when you roll a green." Truth or Fiction? - Roll a purple and you reveal something about yourself. Is it truth or fiction? Only you know. The more people you fool- the more you move ahead!" You Are. - Not yourself when you roll a yellow. Maybe you are having an identity crisis- who knows? Just be who the card says for thirty seconds and you can move ahead." What The! - When you roll a blue- you'll get a TOP SECRET card that you must perform before your next turn. It could be annoying- outlandish- confusing- obnoxious or just plain freakish. You have been warned.[newline]Product Number: SP52999,https://assets.sellers.loblaw.ca/products/all/1069/52999_1.jpg?size=274,https://www.loblaws.ca/furt-board-game/p/SP52999
