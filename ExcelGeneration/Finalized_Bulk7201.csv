Toys- Games & Hobbies,Catan Board Game by Catan Studio for Ages 8 years and up,7311,$105.53,,In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan)- players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements- cities- and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)wood- grain- brick- sheep- or stoneto build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.[newline][newline][newline]Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles- some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks- which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used)- are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are- in turn- placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.[newline][newline][newline]A turn consists of possibly playing a development card- rolling the dice- everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded citiesthink: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled- turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements- trading cards at a port- and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled- the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.[newline][newline][newline]Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities- having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards)- and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret)- he announces his total and claims the win.[newline][newline]Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015- it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions- portable edition and compact edition- as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition)- as an anniversary wooden edition- as a deluxe 3D collector's edition- in the basic Simply Catan- as a beginner version- and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.[newline][newline][newline]Number of Players: 3-4[newline][newline]Playing Time: 60-120 Minutes[newline][newline]Recommended Ages: 8+[newline]Product Number: SP79719,https://assets.sellers.loblaw.ca/products/all/1127/79719_1.jpg?size=274,https://www.loblaws.ca/catan-board-game-by-catan-studio-for-ages-8-years/p/SP79719

Toys- Games & Hobbies,Maranda - Pathagon Strategy Game,7272,$39.95,,PATHAGON is an exciting- ever-changing new strategy game of building paths. While PATHAGON is quick and easy to learn- there is a depth of strategy that will keep you on your toes. Players take turns placing their wooden game pieces on the board in an attempt to build a path from one side of the game board to the other. There is a "trapping" move that allows a player to "trap" and remove one of their opponent's game pieces from the board. The first player to complete the path wins. Sounds simple- doesn't it? The catch is that the two paths cross. Every move has an offensive and defensive consideration. PATHAGON is simple enough to be played by children- strategic enough to engage a true gamer. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner- no ties- stalemates- or cat's games. Handcrafted from high-quality hardwoods- PATHAGON is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.[newline]Product Number: SP151708,https://assets.sellers.loblaw.ca/products/all/1231/151708_2.jpg?size=274,https://www.loblaws.ca/maranda-pathagon-strategy-game/p/SP151708
